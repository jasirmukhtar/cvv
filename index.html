<h1>Theta and Epsilon </h1>
<h2>
  Although both are same person with two different names
She is the love of my life
My days & nights are filled by her thoughts
Everything she says means a lot to me.
She always listens to me,she helped to get the best out of
me
She is the girl who bought me closer to Almighty
After opening my eyes in the morning , she is the first person
i think of
My love to her is beyond words
She is not only my girlfriend , she is a feeling, which i want
to experience always.
She is the one who showed love,affection and care towards my family
Even after hurting her number of times, still she accepts my apology
Thanks almighty for blessing me with such a nice partner
She is the one who frequently reminds me to stay close to my family

 <p>"Tumne meri zindagi mai woh kami bar de
jiska mujhe tasavur b nhi tha"


I Love You
